  ## Features üßÆ

</div>

  - **Sequence Programs**
  that demonstrate the concept of sequences, where instructions are executed in a specific order without any branching or loops.

  - **Selection Programs**
  that demonstrate decision-making in code using conditional statements like if, else if, else, and switch to execute different code blocks based on specific conditions.

  - **Loop Programs**
  that demonstrate iteration, allowing for the execution of a block of code multiple times. Different types of loops such as for, while, and do-while are used.

  - **1-D Arrays Programs**
  that demonstrate the use of 1-D arrays, a data structure used to store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.

  - **2-D Arrays Programs**
  that demonstrate the use of 2-D arrays, which are essentially arrays of arrays, used to store data in a tabular form.
  
  - **Recursive Programs**
  that demonstrate recursion, where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.

  - **Structure Programs**
  that demonstrate the use of structures, which are user-defined data types in C++ that group related variables of different data types.

  - **File Handling Programs**
  that demonstrate file handling, including reading from and writing to files, managing file pointers, and handling file operations.
